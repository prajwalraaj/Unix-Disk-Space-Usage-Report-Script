# Unix Disk Space Usage Report Script
This shell script automates the disk space monitoring process for specific directories on a Unix-based server. It reads a list of directories from a .txt file, calculates space usage for each, appends results to an output file, and then sends the summarized report via email.

This helps with proactive disk space management, especially in enterprise environments like EDW systems where disk overuse can impact critical processes.
